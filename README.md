# KUHN POKER

## SUMMARY:
Using Counter Factual Regret Minimization and regret matching to try and generate the optimal strategy for kuhn poker whose rules are below.
Currently not sure if the commented part of my cfr functions is the optimal strategy or if the current strategy is optimal should run sims to test.
Also very possible I made a mistake and this is not optimal plus I believe there are an infinite number of optimal strategies for at least player 1
and probably for player 2. Will add sims and then change accordingly.

## RULES OF THE GAME:
Only 2 players
Only 3 cards Jack,Queen,King
First Player can either bet or check
Second player can either call/fold if bet to or bet/check if checked to
If the first player checks and the second player bets player1 can either call or fold
Each player posts 1 chip before the start of the game
Each bet can only be 1 chip
Maximum pot is 4 chips meaning the maximum amount one can win to lose (add to stack) is 2
