THE COUNTER FACTUAL VALUE AT HISTORY H WITH A GIVEN STRATEGY S IS:

let u[i] = summing player payoff u[i] for each terminal history multiplied
by the probability of reaching that terminal history

let n$(h,h') = the probability of reaching history h' from history h
following the original strategy S

let n%(h,h') = the probability of reaching history h' from history h follwoing
strategy S WHERE ONLY CONSIDERING THE PROBABILITIES OF THE PLAYER OTHER THAN than the
one you are calculating regtet for

Z = set of all terminal states
z = an elemnt of z that exists in z
z { Z will mean exists in

h0 = root node


sum for all z: u[i] * (z)  * n$(h,z) * n%(h0,h)

#first part just
means u[i] to some
terminal payoff
i think


IN SUMMARY:
----------
To break this down: the payoff to the regret-updating player at that terminal history,
multiplied by the probability of reaching that terminal history from the current history when
playing according to strategy Ïƒ, multiplied by the probability of chance and your opponent
allowing you to reach the current history from the beginning of the game.
